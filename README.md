Title - Mondis (Monetary Disaster Help)

Description:

This is the app that can be used to provide post-disaster monetary help to the families of people who suffered from the disaster. The working of this app will be quite easy and useful.


The startup interface of the app would display the list of the recent disaster that has occurred, on clicking on any one of them a screen would pop up with the following details:

1. Name 
2. Condition(i.e- killed,injured,severely injured,missing)
3. Contact number(preferably paytm number)
4. Hometown
5. A/c Number    

These details would be obtained by the developers of the app from the government in the initial phase and later liberty would be given to the concerned local government to add/delete the names of casualties according to the circumstances. This is done to ensure that no bogus entry appears on the app. A separate request button would also be provided on top of the list so that a person can make a request to the government to add the name of the person not present in the list and government can take appropriate action after verifying the details of the concerned person.

Now any person who wants to make a donation to a suffered person from the list he/she can donate by either paying directly through paytm and in case person is not on paytm, payment can be made to the bank account of the concerned person through UPI gateway. The app would also keep the track of the total amount donated to a person via this application, this would help donors to make the right choice of victims making donations more uniform and directly to the account of the family/person suffering the casualty.
